        Aavo Padharo, words of welcome in the language of Gujarat because it is
        here that these words ring truly and the guest is 'God' and the people
        of Gujarat are gregariously friendly, inviting and will entice you to
        come again and again.
        <br /><br />
        Stretches out into the Arabian Sea, with a hint of the desert and with a
        coastline of 1600 kms long is Gujarat – the home state of Mahatma
        Gandhi, the Father of Nation. It is renowned for its beaches, temple
        towns and historic capitals. Wildlife sanctuaries, hill resorts and
        natural grandeur are gifts of Gujarat. Sculpture, handicrafts, arts,
        festivals also make the state rich. Gujarat is also among the most
        technologically advanced, housing the largest petrochemical complex in
        the country.
        <br /><br />
        Gujarat has always been a major centre for the Jains and some of its
        most interesting locations are the Jain Temple centres at Palitana and
        Girnar Hills. Besides the Jain temples, the state’s major attractions
        include the only habitat of the Asiatic Lions in India (Gir Forests), a
        desert ride at the Wild Ass Sanctuary and the beautiful Indo-Saracenic
        Architecture of Ahmedabad. The colourful tribal villages of Kutch make a
        visit unforgettable.

      <p align="justify">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A state with an amazingly varied topography ranging
        from the deep green of the dense forests to stark white at the salt
        plains. Its 1660 kilometers coastline is home to some of the most unique
        marine species and geographical locations at the state makes it an ideal
        matrix, a melting pot of a vast variety of culture, people, places and
        history due to eons of migratory influences. Along with all the
        migrations came in various ritual practices, cuisines, style of dresses,
        fairs and festivals, celebrations all of which were amalgamated and
        became a part of what this amazingly diverse state has to offer to you.
        This was possible as a result of trade, commerce and the dexterity of
        the people of Gujarat to accept and take in and make a part of all who
        come in here for succour, conquest or trade.
